    "## **1. Algorithm Used**\n",
    "The algorithm follows these major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Image Preprocessing**  \n",
    "- The input grayscale image (`img`) is loaded.  \n",
    "- Image dimensions (`height` and `width`) are extracted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Divide Image into Blocks**  \n",
    "- The image is divided into **small overlapping blocks** of size `blocksize √ó blocksize` (default = 8√ó8).  \n",
    "- Each block undergoes the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** to extract **frequency features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Apply DCT & Feature Extraction**  \n",
    "- The **DCT is applied** to each block to extract feature vectors.  \n",
    "- The **Zigzag scanning** is used to convert the DCT matrix into a 1D feature vector.  \n",
    "- The top 16 DCT coefficients are selected as the **feature vector** (excluding the DC component).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Sort Feature Vectors Lexicographically**  \n",
    "- All feature vectors are **sorted lexicographically** to enable fast **block matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Find Similar Blocks using Euclidean Distance**  \n",
    "- A similarity measure based on the **Euclidean Distance** is used to find matching blocks.  \n",
    "- Blocks with a distance below a given threshold (`oklid_threshold`) are considered **potentially copied**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Use Hough Transform for Detection**  \n",
    "- The detected copy-move regions are stored in **Hough space** to eliminate **weak matches**.  \n",
    "- If a match is strong enough (based on a `num_ofvector_threshold`), it is marked as **forged**.  \n",
    "- A bounding box is drawn around detected forged regions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 7: Evaluate Detection using F-measure**  \n",
    "- The detected image is compared against the **ground truth mask** using **Precision, Recall, and F-measure**.  \n",
    "- The **F-measure** is calculated as:  \n",
